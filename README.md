## Documentation

You can learn more about ProceZeus by [visiting the official documentation page](https://cyberjusticelab.github.io/JusticeAI/docs/rendered/). These docs were generated with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

All of the project's services are split into separate Docker images. All application dependencies are contained within the Docker images. The dependencies required to run this project locally are:

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`

### Installing

To install Docker and Docker Compose, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/).

## Running the Entire Application Stack

We've developed a script to help with running the entire application with all its components. It's a thin wrapper around `docker-compose`, so all `docker-compose` will work for it. All you need is:

```bash
./cjl build && ./cjl up
```

If you want to suppress output push the job to the background:

```bash
./cjl up -d
```

Docker isn't always the best at determining diffs between images. If that happens, you can destroy ___all___ Docker images on your host with:
```bash
./cjl clean [-y]
```

To run all tests and lints for all services:

```bash
./cjl test
```

To try to fix all linting errors for all services:

```bash
./cjl lint-fix
```

In order to shut down all containers:

```bash
./cjl down
```

Finally, if you want to reset the database (Helps with inconsistent database states), you can run:

```bash
./cjl reset-db
```

The `cjl` script also takes any other command that `docker-compose` can take.

## Running or Testing Specific Services

The following services can run individually or tested against:
- [Web Client](src/web_client/README.md)
- [Backend Service](src/backend_service/README.md)
- [Machine Learning Service](src/ml_service/README.md)
- [Natural Language Processing Service](src/nlp_service/README.md)
- [PostgreSQL Database](src/postgresql_db/README.md)

## Deployment

Deployment is done via Travis CI and Ansible. The most current version of the master branch is reflected on the [Demo Page](https://capstone.cyberjustice.ca)

## Architecture

The following architecture diagram represents the various services and the relationships they have with one another.
