You only need an account if you want Procezeus to remember you on your next visit. \n\nInformation we generated\n- The information we generate from processing text responses or parsing uploads is anonymized. \n- Procezeus’ minions process the text and remove any identifying elements, ex. name, addresses, etc. from the data before storing them as values in the database under a user ID.\n- These values may be further processed by Procezeus’ divine computation systems.\n- These values may, from time to time, be complied and shared for the purposes of research. \n- Procezeus will never sell your personal information (seriously, it’s not like we need the money )."
