it’s noisy
the hallways are dirty
the janitor never cleans
there is no electricity
there is no heating
there are no locks
there are holes
there are rats
there are odors
there is a stench
my landlord changed the lock without telling me
my landlord replace the lock without advising me
i’m locked outside of my apartment
the dwelling is disgusting
the apartment is greasy
the lodging is nasty
there is an infestation in my apartment
there are rats in my dwelling
there is a stench in my apartment
it smells bad in my place
i can’t live there anymore it’s disgusting
the air is unbreathable
there is smoke everywhere
